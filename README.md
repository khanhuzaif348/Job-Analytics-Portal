# **Job Post Analytics Dashboard**
Project Overview
This project is a Job Post Analytics Dashboard that visualizes job market trends using Tableau. The dashboard is embedded into a web view via an index.html file, allowing users to interact with job data insights seamlessly.

We also use Python (pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and preprocessing, ensuring high-quality, structured data before visualization.
